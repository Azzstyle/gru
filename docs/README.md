## Documentation

A good place to get started is to familiarize yourself with the
[concepts](concepts.md) used in Gru.

Afterwards you should check the [installation](installation.md)
document which provides information on how to obtain and
install Gru.

Once ready with that check the [quickstart](quickstart.md) document,
which will walk you through your first steps with Gru.
