## Documentation

A good place to get started is to familiarize yourself with the
[concepts](concepts.md) used in Gru.

Afterwards you should check the [installation](installation.md)
document which provides information on how to obtain and
install Gru.

Once ready with that check the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md),
which will walk you through your first steps with Gru.

For setting environment variables, make sure to check the
[environment variables](env-vars.md) document.

In order to automatically start your minions during boot-time,
you should check the document for [enabling services](services.md)
during boot-time.

You should also check the documentation of
[available resources](resources/) that you could use in your modules.
